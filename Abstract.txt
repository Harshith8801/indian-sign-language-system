ISL Detection and Translation System Mini Project Abstract

In our previous semester, as part of the Professional Elective subject, we developed a sign language recognition system where a deaf or mute person performs a hand sign and the system detects it and displays the corresponding English word on screen. The idea was straightforward - a person who cannot speak uses sign language, and the system translates that sign into readable text so that a normal user can understand what is being communicated. This helped bridge the basic communication gap between people who use Indian Sign Language (ISL) and those who do not. For this mini project, we are continuing with the same system and adding a reverse process to it. In this new addition, a normal user types or inputs a word in English and the system converts it into the corresponding Indian Sign Language gesture or image. This way, a hearing person who does not know sign language can still communicate with a deaf or mute person by letting the system show the right sign for them. Both features together - sign to text and text to sign - make the system work both ways, which makes communication between normal users and deaf or mute individuals much easier and more practical in real life.
